				<h4>How my dog taught me new tricks during lockdown</h4><br>
				As most of the country prepares to leave lockdown, Lucy Corry shares the lessons she learned from an unlikely teacher.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p id="detailed2" style="display:none;">
				<b>Exercise is important, especially outside excercise</b><br>
				There's nothing like a small bout of self-isolation to make you realise how good it is to be able to go outside. My favourite lockdown coping mechanism is going for a run by myself in the early morning, when there are no cars on the roads and no people to dodge. Having a dog means you have to get out of the house, even when your personal motivation - or the motivation of your other bubble members - is low. Everyone feels better after a walk, including the dog.<br><br>
				<b>Everyone needs time alone</b><br>
				There is one room in our little house where there's no Wifi. And no people. Coincidence? It's also where the dog likes to go and hang out by himself, to snuggle between the cushions on the sofa and bask in the sun. It's a very peaceful place to sit, device-free. Of course, once you're there it doesn't take long before everyone in the house realises where you are and wants to be there too, but five minutes' solitude is very restorative.<br><br>
				<b>Eat as well as you can, but don't overdo it</b><br>
				If ever there's a time to focus on food, it's now. It can be tempting to live from one chocolate biscuit or chewy chicken strip to the next, but proper meals are a better way to punctuate the day. Treats are important for mental wellbeing, but try to save them as rewards for good work, or good doggy behaviour.<br><br>
				<b>Don't let yourself go</b><br>
				Hair unbrushed? Dirty feet? A bit stinky? It might be a while before any of us are hanging out with other people, but that's no reason to drop our usual standards. You don't have to go full Hilary Barry on it, but be assured no one likes to share the sofa with a stinky dog, or teenager. A bit of brushing and washing now will also save you a lecture from the dog groomer/hairdresser later.<br><br>
				<b>No one likes a barking dog</b><br>
				In other words, don't go off on a meaningless rant because you're upset about something. Barking incessantly is the dog version of being a keyboard warrior on social media. It puts everyone in a bad mood and achieves nothing. If there's a tennis ball taunting you under the sofa, no amount of barking will shift it. In other words: don't moan, take action!<br><br>

				Auckland Council Animal Management is reminding dog owners to be cautious of the seals when walking their pets on a Devonport beach after a seal pup was injured.<br><br>

				<h4>Police deploy dog units to hunt for fleeing driver in Christchurch</h4><br>
				Police are hunting for a person after they fled officers in a stolen vehicle in Christchurch overnight.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p id="detailed4" style="display:none;">
				Police spotted a vehicle with stolen plates on Marshland Rd about 1am on Sunday, a police spokesman said. “Staff signalled the vehicle to stop but the driver failed to do so and staff did not pursue.” He said the vehicle was found a short time later abandoned on Old Windsor Ln in Bottle Lake. Police deployed dog units to track the driver, but they were unable to find them. Police were continuing to make enquiries to find them, he said<br><br>
